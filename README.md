# App Reviews

### Problem:
Businesses want insights on their customers, going through your app’s play store or App Store reviews is one of the best way to do this. Because most apps have thousands of reviews, it becomes really hard to get all the insights you can out of these reviews.

### Where we come in: 
We’ll be creating a website that go through these companies reviews, and gives insights about customer sentiment sentiments based on topics, app version etc. 

### Market Segment Target: 
Companies that have mobile apps.
